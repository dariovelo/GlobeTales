    <p>This app is a fully responsive website built with the MERN stack. It's designed to unite travel enthusiasts by allowing you to
    share your travel experiences from the countries you’ve visited. By
    contributing your insights, recommendations, tips, and warnings, you
    help others who are planning their own adventures.</p>

    <p>Once you log in with your personal credentials, you'll be presented with a list of European countries. You can filter posts based on your country of interest. Below the filtering options, you'll find a button to add and share your own experiences.</p>

    <p>All posts are public and can be
    viewed by everyone, and you have the ability to edit or delete your
    published content. For a more personalized touch, click the Profile
    button in the top left corner. This will take you to a world map
    where you can track and showcase the countries you’ve visited.
    Others can see your travel history, giving you a chance to brag
    about your adventures while sharing your experiences with the
    community.</p>
